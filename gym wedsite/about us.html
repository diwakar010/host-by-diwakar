Effort is different for all of us. When we work out, we should be rewarded for what we put in. So we invented Myzone Effort Points (MEPs), tailored to how hard your heart is working; not to your fitness level.
Reach different zones on-screen based on your heart rate. Each zone is worth a different number of MEPs. The harder you work, the more you earn. Instant feedback tells you when to ease off or step up as you enter each zone. MEPs transform average workouts into a game with motivation and engagement guaranteed.
Forget hiding at the back, we're stronger together, sharing the experience.
